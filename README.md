# sales-tax-calculator-webapp
A springboot application that provides a printable pdf of your sales tax receipt


This application calculates the sales tax and total cost of items in a shopping basket. The basic sales tax rate is 10% on all goods, except for books, food, and medical products which are exempt. Additionally, there is a 5% import duty sales tax on all imported goods. The application will take the name and price of each item in the shopping basket as input and output a receipt that includes the name and price of each item, the total sales tax, and the total cost of the basket. The sales tax will be rounded up to the nearest 0.05 based on the tax rate.
